# Satellite to Map Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks

## Introduction
This project presents a novel approach for the image-to-image translation of satellite images to maps using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The proposed approach employs a conditional GAN (cGAN) architecture to generate high-quality and semantically consistent maps from satellite images.

## Methodology
The cGAN architecture used in this project consists of a generator and a discriminator:
- **Generator**: Converts satellite images into maps.
- **Discriminator**: Evaluates the generated maps for realism.
## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
        cd your-repository
    ```
2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
## Usage/Examples
1. Prepare the dataset of satellite images and corresponding map images.

2. Preprocess the dataset by resizing and normalizing the images.

3. Train the cGAN model using the provided training script:
```bash
    python train.py --dataset path_to_your_dataset
```
